    "1. $\\gamma$ is a vector which has dependence on $q$, $\\theta$, $\\phi$ in spherical coordinates. The q dependence is an enveloping function that allows for dependence on the momentum of the electrons; thus, momentum-dependent coupling. Additionally, $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ copmonents can help the scattering processes be non isotropic.\n",
    "2. $\\gamma$ is a sum of sigmoid curves (tanh(x)+1) or $e^x/(e^x+1)$ which are centered at different temperatures to turn on certain scattering processes or mode couplings and parameterize the distribution of electron-phonon interaction strengths.\n",
